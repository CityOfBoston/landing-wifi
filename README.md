# City of Boston Starter

This is a basic Jekyll starter project. It uses Gulp for building everything, so that we can more easily incorporate things like BrowserSync, Stylus and any necessary plugins.

To get up and running, download (or fork) this repo. Then in your project run:

``` sh
bundle install
npm install
gulp
```

At this point, you should be able to visit `https://0.0.0.0:3000`.

There is a file for each location. To add more locations, just add them to the _locations directory.
